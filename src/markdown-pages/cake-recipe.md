# Cake Recipe
Cakes come in different shapes and sizes, but being delicious is something they all have in common. In this project you'll be practising basic HTML skills by creating a page for a cake recipe (you get to choose the cake). You can share an old familiy recipe or a brand new one you just created. What is important is that you use HTML to create a web page that displays the recipe for readers.
## User Stroies
* User can view the name of the cake.
* User can view a brief description (and possibly the history and origins) of the cake.
* User can view the number of people the recipe serves.
* User can view how long it takes to make the recipe.
* User can view the list of ingredients required by the recipe.
* User can view the instructions for making the cake.
* User can view a picture of a cake.

## Extras
* User can view the nutritional value of the cake (presented as a table).

## Userful Links
* [BBC's cake recipes](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/category/cakes-baking)

## Rules
* Use only HTML (no CSS styling is needed).

## Hints
* Ingredients have no predefined order (use unordered list).
* Instructions need to be followed in order (use ordered list).

## Examples
